# Purpose

This memo compares old wells dataset we've been using up to this point with a revised wells dataset provided by Mary Willis and her group. If there are differences in the number of wells in each study state, we'll re-do those analyses.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("../../code/0-setup/01-setup.R")
```

```{r data_input, include=FALSE}
wells_all_old <- readRDS("../../data/processed/wells_all.rds")
wells_all_new <- read_csv("../../data/raw/enverus/US_Wells.csv")
```

### Table: Well count by state

**Old dataset:**

```{r}
summary(as.factor(wells_all$state))
```

**New dataset:**

```{r}
summary(as.factor(wells_all_new$State))
```

There are some substantial differences, especially for CA: 110,000 fewer wells in the new dataset. What's going on there?
